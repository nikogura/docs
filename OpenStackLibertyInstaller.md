## One Shot OpenStack Liberty Installer

Here's a little gem I keep on my keychain.  Want to create a full Open Stack Liberty cloud from nothing with a single script?  [Open Stack Liberty Installer](https://github.com/nikogura/stackutils/blob/master/bin/stackinit)  

Now that's intended to work with [boxinit.py](https://github.com/nikogura/stackutils/blob/master/boxinit.py)

The directions are here: [https://github.com/nikogura/stackutils](https://github.com/nikogura/stackutils)

Granted, that's a little dated.  Open Stack Liberty is pretty old school at this point.  It will get you an idea of how I like to roll though.  Enjoy.  

*(Wait, you keep an OpenStack installer on your keychain? Yup.  Because I can.)*
