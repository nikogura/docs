# docs
Nik Ogura's document repo.

Contains interesting tidbits that might be of use to others, and it's a good place for me to store my various rantings.

Most docs that are intended to be just read are in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) format.

Others are LaTeX, which is a typsetting markup language.  LaTeX docs end in .tex usually, and are processed into PDF.
  
This repo also contains LaTeX classes for the truly masochistic that would like to write LaTeX themselves.

Why is your resume posted online?  Well, I got sick of traditonal CV's and such where you make this blah blah blah list of hot keywords that you hope will help you make it past the filters.

I though, you know what?  I explain these various experiences so often to various people, wouldn't it be great if I could just link to it?  Better yet, what about having my fascinating journey through technology in a format where I didn't have to try to squash it down to n pages?

So here it is.  I'm not giving away any sort of private information.  Everyone within earshot of me when a particular point was brought up has probably heard the stories enough to repeat them by heart.  

Sorry about that.  I can't resist a good story, even if the cashier at Chevron really doesn't want to hear about asymmetric encryption right now...
