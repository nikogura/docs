# docs
Nik Ogura's document repo.

Contains interesting tidbits that might be of use to others, and it's a good place for me to store my various rantings.

Most docs that are intended to be just read are in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) format.

Others are LaTeX, which is a typsetting markup language.  LaTeX docs end in .tex usually, and are processed into PDF.
  
This repo also contains LaTeX classes for the truly masochistic that would like to write LaTeX themselves.
